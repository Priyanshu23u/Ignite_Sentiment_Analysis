FlipKart Sentiment Analysis

📌 Overview

Flipkart Sentiment Analysis is a deep learning-based project designed to classify sentiment in Flipkart product reviews. Using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Neural Networks, this model can determine whether a review is positive or negative.

🚀 Features

Sentiment classification of Flipkart reviews

Deep learning model using TensorFlow & Keras

NLP techniques for text preprocessing

Model evaluation with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

Data visualization for insights

🛠️ Tech Stack

Programming Language: Python

Machine Learning & Deep Learning: TensorFlow, Keras, Scikit-learn

Natural Language Processing (NLP): NLTK, SpaCy, TF-IDF, Word Embeddings

Data Handling & Processing: Pandas, NumPy

Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn

Model Evaluation: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score

Development & Deployment: Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab

📂 Dataset

The dataset consists of ~20,000 Flipkart product reviews.

It includes two main columns: review_text (customer review) and sentiment (label: positive/negative).

🔍 Approach

Data Preprocessing:

Tokenization, stop-word removal, TF-IDF vectorization.

Model Training:

Implemented a feedforward neural network using TensorFlow/Keras.

Activation functions: ReLU (hidden layers), Sigmoid (output layer).

Optimizer: Adam

Loss function: Binary Crossentropy

Evaluation & Visualization:

Analyzed model performance using classification metrics.

Visualized results with Matplotlib & Seaborn.

📊 Results

Achieved an accuracy of ~85% on the test set.

Improved sentiment prediction using NLP-based preprocessing.

📖 How to Use

1️⃣ Clone the repository

git clone https://github.com/Priyanshu23u/Ignite_Sentiment_Analysis.git
cd Ignite_Sentiment_Analysis

2️⃣ Install dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt

3️⃣ Run the model

python sentiment_analysis.py

📌 Future Improvements

Implement LSTM or Transformer-based models for better accuracy.

Extend the dataset for a more diverse sentiment analysis.

Deploy the model using Flask/FastAPI for real-time predictions.Ignite Sentiment Analysis
